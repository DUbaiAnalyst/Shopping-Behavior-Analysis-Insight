# Shopping-Behavior-Analysis-Insight
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze customer purchasing patterns and behaviors within a dataset of 3,900 transactions, focusing on key factors such as age, gender, product category, seasonality, and customer satisfaction. By examining these variables, the goal is to uncover meaningful insights into who buys what, when, and why helping to identify high-value customer segments, seasonal sales trends, and potential marketing opportunities. Ultimately, the project aims to support data-driven decision-making in e-commerce strategy, product planning, and targeted promotions for improved customer engagement and sales performance.

## KPQs
-	Which age group contributes the most to total purchases?
-	Is there a difference in purchasing behavior between genders?
-	Which product categories generate the highest and lowest sales?
-	How do seasons affect sales volume and customer satisfaction?
-	What strategic opportunities can be drawn from these insights?

## Project Insight
-	The 55+ age group contributes the highest share of transactions (30%).
-	Male customers dominate spending across all four product categories — Accessories, Clothing, Footwear, and Outerwear — with total purchases more than twice those of females.
-	Clothing consistently generates the highest total purchase value across all seasons, while Outerwear records the lowest, possibly due to limited seasonal demand.
-	Spring is the most active shopping period, followed by Fall, Winter, and Summer. Customer satisfaction peaks for Footwear in Fall and Winter, and for Accessories and Outerwear in Spring, suggesting seasonal influence on purchase satisfaction.
-	Businesses can focus on older and male demographics for higher returns, optimize seasonal marketing campaigns, and ensure product availability aligns with peak demand periods like Spring and Fall.

## Process
-	Gathered a dataset of 3,900 containing attributes such as Age Group, Gender, Category, Purchase Amount, Season, and Review Rating.
-	Removed missing values, standardized data formatting
-	Used pivot tables, charts, and filters in Excel to identify: Purchase distribution across age and gender, Seasonal purchase patterns, and Category performance by revenue and rating
-	Built an interactive Excel dashboard featuring: KPIs (Total Sales, Number of Orders, Average Rating, etc.), Bar charts for purchases by age and gender, Seasonal trend charts, and Category-wise performance visualizations
-	Interpreted dashboard visuals to extract key findings about demographic behavior, seasonal influence, and satisfaction patterns.
-	Summarized findings into a concise report and LinkedIn post, highlighting actionable insights for marketing and business strategy.

## Conclusion
The Shopping analysis provides clear evidence that age, gender, and seasonality significantly influence purchasing behavior. The 55+ age group and male customers are the most active buyers, while Spring emerges as the peak shopping season. Clothing dominates overall sales, but Footwear receives the highest satisfaction ratings during cooler months. These insights underscore the importance of targeted marketing, seasonal product planning, and customer segmentation in driving e-commerce growth. Expanding this study with larger datasets or additional variables (such as region or income) could further refine strategic decision-making and uncover deeper behavioral insights.
